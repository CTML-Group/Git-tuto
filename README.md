# What is Git?

>> notes

It is a open-source <code>version control</code> tool that manages <code>different version</code> of your codes/files, <code>create a history of changes</code> and <code>tracks the changes</code>. Centralised and Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) are most common version control system existing in community.

## Centralised Version Control System (CVCS) 
- All the files, project files version history should be saved in central server
- To make changes you need to work locally once done push it to central server
- You will need access to central server
- You’ll only checkout the files you needed to modify therefore you won’t have complete version of code locally
- If something happens to central server, you may not be able to connect to your files
- Softwares such as Subversion uses centralised VCS.

## Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)  
- You’ll always have access to copy of entire project and its version history locally
- To make changes you can work both locally or remotely (github.com), if you choose to work locally you will just need to connect to server for a few mins to sync your files to remote server
- You can access your files from anywhere across the globe
- Softwares such as GitHub, Mercurial etc. uses disttributed VCS.
